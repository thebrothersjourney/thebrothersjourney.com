👋 Welcome, it's great to have you here.

As the world goes into lockdown over the COVID-19 virus I suddenly have much more time on my hands. So instead of being a couch potato and watch everything on Netflix I decided to take action and commit to doing something productive.

Years ago my friend planted a seed 🌱 where I could make money from blogging. He showed me the methods and ways, but I always had an excuse of "No time!". Well I guess now I have suddenly found a lot of time on my hands. 

So here we are... My first blog post 🎉

What can you expect here? Anything and everything. This blog will act as a brain dump for me where you can find anything from 💻 tech tips to 📈📉 forex trading ideas, 🥊 weight loss to 🍱 home cooking and my journey into starting a small business. 

Hopefully there is something on this blog that inspires you to live a better life. Remember 💡 Great ideas start from a planted 🌱 seed.
