🦠 = 🌏 + 🔐 COVID-19 puts the world into lockdown

👋 Welcome, it’s great to have you here. 

As the COVID-19 spreads across the world and our lives are suddenly put on hold with major disruptions across all business we have now suddenly found ourselves isolated from each other.

The government is taking extreme measures to reduce the curve in a bid to control the infections. It might seem like the end of the world is upon us with everyone suddenly working from home and the streets becoming a ghost town. 👻🏠

While most people are living their best lives as potato’s 🥔 watching Netflix and YouTube. I’ve decided to finally dust off my huge todo list 📝 and finally start all those projects that I have been putting off.

Guess what? This blog is one of them. For years I have dreamt of having a blog which can generate money while I sleep. This must be my 3rd or 4th attempt, but with no excuses, I’m finally going to do it. 

My blog will be filled with a lot of different information from technical tips to forex trading, business startups to productivity hacks. As you can see it’s going to be a mixed bag. 🎒

As you can see the site is very.... default. This is done on purpose. Over the life of the blog, I’ll document my journey on making this a much nicer place to be, but I figured if I had waited for everything to be 💯 I would never launch this site. 

So grab a coffee, sign up to the mailing list (once I get it working 😄) and come with me on my journey to living a better life.
