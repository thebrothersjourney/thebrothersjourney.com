You may not know this, but this blog has gone through a lot of revisions to get to where it is today. My site seems nice new, but it started out its humble life in a much different way.

## Wordpress & BlueHost

<img src="/assets/img/wordpress-and-bluehost.jpg">

This blog first started out as a <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> installation hosted on <a href="https://bluehost.com" target="_blank">BlueHost</a>. I was naive and followed the instructions from a blog which promoted blogging as a career. 

Personally, I don’t mind Wordpress, but it was overkill for my needs and I could never get the performance I was after. I spent countless hours optimising, but could never get a good score with the website tests. 

For me, it was more about optimisation than blogging and because of this, i gave up on blogging. 😭

Most would see this as a waste of my time, but to me when I FAIL it allowed me to learn... and boy did I learn. 

	• Wordpress is slow don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
	• Not all themes are created equal. 
	• You’ll learn the difference between shared hosting and dedicated hosting really quickly.
	• Blogging is hard when your site is slow.
	• You’ll have to pay good money💰 or invest a lot of time ⏱.
	• Blogging is not as simple as it seems.
	• You’ll be good friends with webpage speed tests.

Not to sound like I’m hating on Wordpress, but if I took some time to do the research I would have saved myself a lot of time and maybe my first endeavour would have been my only.

💡 I’ll update this blog with some tips to optimise your Wordpress site. 

## GitHub Pages & Jekyll

<img src="/assets/img/github-pages-and-jekyll.jpg">

Over the years I have really put a focus on documentation. Look I’m not a fan and don’t enjoy documentation, but damn... I write some really good documents. I have never been a fan of doing it all in word with templates and wanted something that would be cross-platform and something easier to manage. 

👋 Hello Markdown!

Markdown allows me to rapidly create documents without thinking about how things will look. I can just focus on writing documents and let someone else deal with how it looks. 

Today all my notes are in markdown even if the editor doesn’t support it. So my second attempt at blogging I was smarter and did some research on getting a blog running as cheap as possible. This was achieved with <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. 

My total hosting costs were an astounding $15 a year. That’s just to register my domain. Hosting fees... GONE. GitHub Pages allows you to host static sites for FREE. 🎉

With so many examples over the internet promoting beautify fast sites with GitHub and Jekyll. You could say I was like Charmander and the fire 🔥 was ignited once again. 
 
It took me a day to go live and publish my first post. For the first time, I finally felt that I could now get on with blogging and not worry about making it any faster.

Unfortunately, this lasted all of three months... 🥺 It’s not what you’re thinking. I got approached by a friend that wanted to collaborate on a financial blog so this took a back seat while I started this new project.

I would highly recommend GitHub Pages and Jekyll for anyone on a budget and wants to dip their toes in the blogging world. There is a bit of a learning curve, but it's well worth the effort.

## Netlify & Jigsaw

<img src="/assets/img/netlify-and-jigsaw.jpg">

This is my current setup and what you are currently seeing. <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.co" target="_blank">Jigsaw</a> is another static site generator, but it is based on <a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank">Laravel</a> my favourite PHP framework. I have been recently getting into DevOps at work and loving continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). 

<a href="https://netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a> is a hosting company with a great free tier. So again my only costs are domain renewal fees (unless this blog takes off like a rocket ship 🚀). Using CI/CD workflow makes my life easy. 

	1. Write a post in markdown.
	2. Create some images.
	3. Optimise images.
	4. Commit changes to the Github repository
	5. The site automatically deploys with new changes.

Now I can focus on writing blogs and creating images to go with it. The rest of the blog automatically builds and uploads. What more can you want? 🤓 Also did I mention how quick it was out of the box? 🏎

## Where to now?
For now, I am happy with the flexibility of Jigsaw and the default theme. There will be changes as I learn new things, but fingers crossed 🤞 I’ll be more consistent with this blog. 

Keep your eyes open for more content as I bash my keyboard ⌨️ and hopefully produce decent content for you.
